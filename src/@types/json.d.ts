Matches a JSON object.

This type can be useful to enforce some input to be JSON-compatible or as a super-type to be extended from. Don't use this as a direct return type as the user would have to double-cast it: `jsonObject as unknown as CustomResponse`. Instead, you could extend your CustomResponse type from it to ensure your type only uses JSON-compatible types: `interface CustomResponse extends JsonObject { â€¦ }`.
